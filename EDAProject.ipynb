Also perform some activities in the set using python.Since it is my first time using orange, I tried all the options all could in order to familiarize myself with the software, using the Titanic dataset of course. In order to make a final conclusion of there are specific factors that influenciate the survival range of the persons inside the ship, I will use distributions, plots, as other visualization tools.  \n![Orange testing using Titanic Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abril-Barrera/Smart-Business-Systems/master/all.PNG)\n\n\n### 2. **Problem Definition**\n\nThe Titanic was a passenger ship that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in April 1912 after colliding with an iceberg during its first travel from Southampton to New York City. It had an estimated of 2,224 passengers + the workers of the ship. More than 1,500 died in this accident and that is why this is a very famous case of study nowadays. It is often considered as the “hello world” of the data analysis, since it is worldwide used to get into the matter.\n\nThe idea is to find out if there were any factors that influenciated in the survival or death of the passengers as well as determine them (in case there are), but just by the previous look at the data I am starting to diverge into the hipotesis that the statement is true. I also expect the age, gender and class type variables to be very important just by the logical approach of the problem, but I will have to prove is that is correct with the adequate information.\n\n### 3. **Dataset Description**\n\nThe Titanic dataset contains several info about the passengers age, sex, ticket class, etc. As well as the survival value.It is composed by these 12 variables as shown in Orange while loading the CVS file.\n\n![Variables of the titanic dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abril-Barrera/Smart-Business-Systems/master/eda1.PNG)\n\n#### __Description of each variable__\n\n_survival:    Survival  (0= died 1=survived)\nPassengerId: Unique Id of a passenger. \npclass:    Ticket class  (1=1st, 2=2nd, 3=3rd class tickets)\nsex:    Sex     \nAge:    Age in years     \nsibsp:    # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic     \nparch:    # of parents / children aboard the Titanic     \nticket:    Ticket number     \nfare:    Passenger fare     \ncabin:    Cabin number     \nembarked:    Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)_\n\n### 4. **Justification of analysis**\n\nIt is possible to make different approaches to the data. The suggestion was to make an exploration whether there were certain factors that causes if someone survived the catastrophe of \"Titanic\" or not. For this one, we could take into a consideration vairables as class or age. Since they could give me a lead on this question and help me create an hipotesis. However I am going to be doing different analysis and visualizations while trying to find the most interesting comparitions. As well as trying the different tools Orange offers in order to analyze data.\n\nThe main focus as I said before will be to find the biggest factors in the person's survival rate. Because of this I will select the survival variable as my target. As well as clasify the name, ticket and cabin as metadata variables. First of all, I am going to visualize the general data by using the \"Data Table\" option in orange. Since the beginning I notice some very important details as there are no missing values in the survival variable, that there is a rate of missing values of 2.5% in the feature values and a 25.7% in the metadata ones.\n\n![Titanic Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abril-Barrera/Smart-Business-Systems/master/eda2.PNG)\n\n\n### 5. **Use of Orange**\n \n * Plots \n I tried all kind of plots in order to find patrons, the most helpful option was definitely the box plot. The box plot allowed me to visualize the quartiles and in consecuence where most part of the passengers population was in. Also the median and the mean, in order to see the tendency of the information.\n 1. Box Plot, fare, survived. _Through this plot, I obteined the mean of both cases in the survival variable. Being the mean of fare the the survivals more the **double** of the people who died, making me think that the people that were richer were most likely to survive. \n \n ![Box Plot, fare, survived](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abril-Barrera/Smart-Business-Systems/master/plot2.PNG)\n \n 2. Scatter plot of Age, Pclass and survival. _I can see a clear tendency looking at this graph, the survival rate increases as equal as the class. In other words, the first class people survived the most. Most people who survived and where in 3rd and 2nd class were young ones. When it comes to the first class, people of all kind of ages survived but most of them are in a range between 15-55 years._\n \n ![Scatter plot of Age, Pclass and survival variables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abril-Barrera/Smart-Business-Systems/master/plot1.PNG)\n \n 3. Box plot of survival & embarked variable. _The people who embarked in Queenstown basically died and survive equally. While people who embarked in Southampton died most than survive (there isn't a big difference still). And the opposite is with the Cherbourg people (they survived the most), 2/3 of them survived._\n \n ![Box plot of survival & embarked variable](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abril-Barrera/Smart-Business-Systems/master/plot3.PNG)\n \n 4. Box plot survival and sex. _A clear tendency of sex influencing the survival. As the plot shows women survived much more than men. Since 70% of the survivors were women, the famous saying of the titanic \"women and children first\" was definitely a true statement._\n  \n ![Box plot sex and survival](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abril-Barrera/Smart-Business-Systems/master/plot4c.PNG)\n \n 5. Box plot age and survival. _Most of the survivals are around 19-36 years old, 25% of them are kids and teenagers (less than 18 or less). Apparently almost no kids died in the incident since the first quartile of the deads starts from 17 years old.\n \n ![Box plot sex and survival](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abril-Barrera/Smart-Business-Systems/master/plot5cc.PNG)\n \n * Distributions\n \n 1. Normal distribution Age/Frequency 5 Width. _The general population on the ship were in the range of 0-80 years, but using the normal distribution we can see the bell goes from 0 -60 years, so normally I consider the rest as “outliers”. Even so, I’m not removing any kind of data of the dataset since I don’t consider it appropriate in this case._\n \n  ![Normal distribution Age/Frequency 5 Width](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abril-Barrera/Smart-Business-Systems/master/dis1.PNG)\n \n 2. Distribution by parch-survived. _The data is very upfront when it comes to having 2 or mor parents or children in the ship, there isn’t a difference at all. When it comes to having 1 related then it seems like the possibility to do not survive increased but the results are very inconclusive since there is a very small tendency._\n \n ![Distribution by parch-survived](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abril-Barrera/Smart-Business-Systems/master/dis2.PNG)\n \n \n 3. Normal distribution by SibSp-survived. _Again, I don’t think the data is very conclusive, but there is a more clear tendency here, passengers that had 1 sibling or spouse survived more, but after that the results are very similar for the passengers who had more than one sibling or spouse in the ship._\n \n ![Normal distribution by SibSp-survived](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abril-Barrera/Smart-Business-Systems/master/dis3.PNG)\n \n \n 4. Normal distribution age-survived. _This distribution is very interesting for this dataset because it shows the bell of survivals and dead passengers. There are 2 ranges, the survival bell range is between 0-56 years old. While the non-survival one is from 0 to 60. A larger range makes sense because the amount of people who died is bigger than the survivors._\n  \n  ![Normal distribution age-survived](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abril-Barrera/Smart-Business-Systems/master/dis4.PNG)\n \n\n  * Discretizations\n  \n  \n 1. Discretization of age variable. _Using a discretization to visualize the data is another good tool. In this example I separated ages in 7 ranges. This allowed me to obtain very precise info. As confirming that the bigger survivor group were kids. As well as people that were between 30-36 years old. Also that 10% of the people how died in the accident were less than 16 years old and this was the smallest group of age._ \n  \n  ![Discretization of age variable](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abril-Barrera/Smart-Business-Systems/master/discret1.PNG)\n\n  \n### 6. **Conclusion**\n\nAt the end there is a clear tendency that is appropiate for all the analysis I did. Women were the ones that survived the most (70% percent of the survivors), also most of the kids survived as well. After that, the people with a higher class (1st class people) were the ones that survived the most, followed by 2nd class ones. Most of the population were around 15-55 acording with the normal distribution. I didnt find any conclusive information about the parch and the sibsp variables causing a real effect on the survival rate, when it comes to having parents/children in the ship, the analysis is clear, it didn't matter at all. When it comes to siblings/spouses the results show a small tendency to having more than one sibling and not surviving, but as I said it is really small, I don't think is appropiate to conclude so based on the small tendency.\n\nI can say the most vulnerable group were: men, 3rd class, embarked on Southampton, were more than 18 years old, didn't have a sibling/spouse/parent/children or had 2 or more and payed a low fare. While the most survival group were: women, 1st class, embarked on Cherbourg, were between 0-36 years old, had 1 sibling/spouse/parent/children amd payed a high fare.\n\nSo I can say, there were factors that actually made an impact in the survivals. The most important ones in order: gender, age and class. Variables as and fare, embarked mattered too but they are really related to the class one (economical status). The rest, I don't think are so reelevant but I still could infer some informations. The rest of variables were metadata so I didn't really use it at all in this analysis. \n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":""},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":""}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.10","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
